The Data folder contains the map file, each map file consist of 1. first line size of the map, 11 11 means 11*11 map; 2. second line static obstacles coordinates; 3. starting location of each agent group; 4. the goal location of each agent group; 5. size of each agent group. Main.cpp is the main file, inside you will find the main function. The function read a map and translates it into a map class object then executes the algorithm. When finished, it will write the result into result.txt and write the time taken for each run into statistic.txt for future box chart plots if needed. plot.py is the plot file to plot the movement of agents from a result.txt. plotBox.py plot the statistic.txt file to get the box chart for analysis. ploystartgoal.py will plot the map, obstacles, staring locations, and goal locations using map.txt file to provide user a visual check if any of these are conflicting even before the program is running. Run makefile to compile all the necessary
